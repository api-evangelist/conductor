# Conductor (conductor)
Conductor allows you to build a complex application using simple and granular tasks that do not need to be aware of or keep track of the state of your application's execution flow. Conductor keeps track of the state, calls tasks in the right order (sequentially or in parallel, as defined by you), retry calls if needed, handle failure scenarios gracefully, and outputs the final result.
